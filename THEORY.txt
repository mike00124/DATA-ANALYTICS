To tackle this assignment, here’s a structured approach you can follow:

1. Environment Setup
a)Make sure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries:

Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
2. Understanding the Requirements
a)Input: Either a college name or a URL of the course page.
b)Output: A clean, structured list or dictionary of courses.
Tools: You can use requests to fetch web pages and BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content.
3. Initial Research
Identify a few Delhi University college websites to understand their structure. Check how the courses are listed (HTML tags, structure).
Example colleges could include:
St. Stephen’s College
Hindu College
Miranda House
4. Script Design
Input Handling:
If a college name is provided, map it to its URL.
If a URL is provided, directly proceed to scraping.
Scraping Logic:
Fetch the webpage content using requests.
Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup.
Extract course names using appropriate tags (e.g., h2, li, div with specific class names).
Error Handling:
Handle scenarios where the college name doesn’t exist.
Manage network errors (e.g., timeout).
Handle cases where the course page is not structured well.
Output Formatting:
Store the extracted courses in a list or dictionary.
5. Edge Cases
a)Unavailable pages (404 errors).
b)Incorrect URLs or college names.
c)Courses listed across multiple pages.
